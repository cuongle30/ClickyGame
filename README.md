# Clicky-Game

## Overview

This is a memorygame created using React.


## Instructions

1. The app will display 12 different images.

2. The user's score will be incremented when clicking an image for the first time. The user's score will reset to 0 if they click the same image more than once.

3. Every time an image is clicked, the images will render and shuffle in random order.

4. Once the user's score is reset after an incorrect guess, the game will restart.
